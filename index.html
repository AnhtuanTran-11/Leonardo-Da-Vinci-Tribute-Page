          Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) was a painter, architect, inventor, and
          student of all things scientific. His natural genius crossed so many
          disciplines that he epitomized the term “Renaissance man.” Today he
          remains best known for his art, including two paintings that remain
          among the world’s most famous and admired, Mona Lisa and The Last
          Supper. Art, da Vinci believed, was indisputably connected with
          science and nature. Largely self-educated, he filled dozens of secret
          notebooks with inventions, observations and theories about pursuits
          from aeronautics to anatomy. But the rest of the world was just
          beginning to share knowledge in books made with moveable type, and the
          concepts expressed in his notebooks were often difficult to interpret.
          As a result, though he was lauded in his time as a great artist, his
          contemporaries often did not fully appreciate his genius—the
          combination of intellect and imagination that allowed him to create,
          at least on paper, such inventions as the bicycle, the helicopter and
          an airplane based on the physiology and flying capability of a bat.
